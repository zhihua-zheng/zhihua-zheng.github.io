I'm a graduate student in the School of Oceanography at University of Washington
, Seattle.

I study Physical Oceanography, especially interested in ocean dynamics, the
interaction between small scale (mesoscale) and large scale physical processes
in the ocean and how they affect the Earth's climate.
