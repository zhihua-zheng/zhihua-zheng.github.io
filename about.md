	<p class="intro">Zhihua Zheng is currently a graduate student at <a href="http://ocean.washington.edu/">School of
  Oceanography</a>, University of Washington Seattle.</p>

	<p>He received his B. Sc. degree (with honors) in Marine Sciences in 2017 summer
	from Xiamen University (P.R.C.). During his undergraduate period, he worked with
	Dr. Zhiyu Liu and scientists at State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental
	Science on applying a new inverse method to quantify the mixing and circulation
	in North Pacific Ocean. </p>

	<p>Starting from fall 2017, he joined School of
	Oceanography and Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington
	Seattle to continue the study and research in Physical Oceanography. He is very
	interested in general ocean dynamics and the interactions among physical
	processes of different scales in the ocean and how they contribute to the
	Earthâ€™s climate system. Currently, he is working on a project to develop a more
	advanced mixed layer model to include the influences of wave-current interaction
	(Langmuir cells) and wave breaking on boundary layer turbulence.</p>
